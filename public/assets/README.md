# Profile Image Setup

To complete the setup of your profile image in the circular frame on the landing page:

1. Add your profile image to this directory (`public/assets/`) with the filename `profile-image.jpg`
2. The image should ideally be square and at least 500x500 pixels for best quality
3. A headshot or portrait image works best with the circular frame design

The image will automatically be displayed in the circular frame with the cybersecurity-themed scanning effects and animations.
